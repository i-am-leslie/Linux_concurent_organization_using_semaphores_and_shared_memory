Design goals
* Provided mutual exclusion for selected array elements.

* Achieved a good degree of parallelism by using more than one semaphore to solve problems in less time.

* The parent process  determines when the sorting is complete and the program, can be terminated.

* The program takes in a user input for sorting.

* The debug mode will be used to show which processes are running and how it is sorting the colors
